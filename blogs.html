                <h1>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h1>
                <small>September, 2022</small>
                <p>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning
                    and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
                    page's appearance(CSS) or functionality(JavaScript).
                </p>
                <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by tags, which consist of the element name
                    surrounded by "&lt;" and ">" . The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it
                    can
                    be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the &lt;title> tag can be written as
                    &lt;Title>, &lt;TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to
                    write
                    tags in lowercase.</p>
                <p>An HTML document consists of a certain structure to it: <br>It begins with the &lt;html> tags. Inside
                    comes
                    the &lt;head> tags which contain the &lt;title> tags and finally the &lt;body> tag that contains
                    all the
                    content of
                    the webpage. All these tags are also accompanied by their closing tags. Closing tags are the same as
                    their counterparts other than the difference that they start with "/". eg. &lt;/html>, &lt;/head>,
                    &lt;/body>. </p>
                <p>An HTML document is also where the CSS and Javascript files or functionalities are loaded\added.</p>

                <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
                <small>September, 2022</small>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets are used to style and set the layout of web pages â€” for example,
                    altering the
                    font,
                    color, size, and spacing of the content, splitting it into multiple columns, or adding
                    animations
                    and
                    other decorative features. It is generally used by adding it to an HTML document to
                    style it as you
                    see fit. Each CSS property has a set of valid values, defined by formal grammar, as well
                    as a
                    semantic meaning, implemented by the browser. These values and properties specify the
                    appearance of
                    how, where, what color an element holds.etc, on a webpage.</p>
                <p>Another important facet of CSS is
                    the
                    <strong>box model</strong>. When laying out a document, the browser's renders
                    each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS box model. CSS
                    determines the
                    size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.

                    Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the
                    content,
                    padding, border, and margin :</p>
                <p><strong>1.</strong> The content area, contains the content
                    of the element, such as text, an image, or a video player. It often has a background
                    color or
                    background image. <br> <strong>2.</strong> The padding area,
                    extends the content area to include the element's padding. <br><strong>3.</strong> The
                    border area,
                    extends the
                    padding
                    area to include the element's borders. <br><strong>4.</strong> The margin area, extends
                    the border
                    area to include an
                    empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors.</p>
                <p>The understanding and implementation of these concepts is extremely crucial to being a
                    good designer.
